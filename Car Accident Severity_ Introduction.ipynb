Seattle, a city on Puget Sound in the Pacific Northwest., Washington State\u2019s largest city, is a home to a large tech industry, with Microsoft and Amazon headquartered in its metropolitan area. The city is of high socio-economic value and is rapidly changing with time. The rapid economic growth that the city has developed in the past has resulted in improving the lifestyle of the people living over there. With the raised standard of living in the city, and greater purchasing power of its inhabitants, the number of automobiles on the roads has increased rapidly. With so many people owning and operating vehicles on the roads, problems like traffic jams, congestion on roads, and road accidents are becoming a common sight. Now, wouldn't it be great if there is something in place that could warn the road users, given the weather and the road conditions about the possibility of them getting into a car accident and how severe it would be, so that they would drive more carefully or even change their travel if they are able to? Well, this is exactly what this project addresses. The data for this work was taken from open data platform hosted by the city of Seattle found <a href= https://data.seattle.gov/Land-Base/Collisions/9kas-rb8d>here</a>. This includes all types of collisions from 2004 to Present. This data is updated weekly, so the presented analysis is based on the data collected at that time (Wednesday, 07 October 2020). This dataset also provides information regarding the cause and type of the collisions.</div>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
